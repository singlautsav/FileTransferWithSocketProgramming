# FileTransferWithSocketProgramming

The program works for sending a file stored at server to the client side on request generated by the client.

## Process

2. Start the client using `./ClientFolder/client`
3. Add the file name when requested by the client program.

## Note
Kindly run the server and client on different terminals :)
